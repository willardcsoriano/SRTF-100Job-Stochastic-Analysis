## Project Overview

This project provides a **web-based simulation and statistical analysis** of the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** CPU scheduling algorithm. The simulation evaluates SRTF performance when handling a **large, randomized workload of 100 jobs**, focusing on:

- **Average Waiting Time (AWT)**
- **Average Turnaround Time (ATT)**

SRTF is a **preemptive algorithm** that always executes the process with the **shortest remaining burst time**, making it one of the most optimal algorithms for reducing waiting time.

## Simulation Parameters

**Job Count:** 100 randomized processes  
**Burst Time (BT):** 1–10 time units  
**Arrival Time (AT):** 1–7 time units  
**Preemption:** Enabled (SRTF behavior)  

Each simulation run produces a unique dataset, making the tool useful for stochastic performance analysis.

## Key Features

- **Automated Large-Scale Job Generation**  
  Generates 100 jobs per run with randomized arrival and burst times.

- **Accurate SRTF Preemptive Logic**  
  The scheduler always selects the job with the shortest remaining burst time.

- **Full Metric Computation**  
  For every job:
  - Completion Time (CT)  
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)  
  - Waiting Time (WT)  
  - Averages for WT and TAT across all jobs  

- **Interactive Data Table**  
  Sortable columns: Job ID, AT, BT, CT, TAT, WT.

- **Dynamic Gantt Chart Visualization**  
  Shows execution order, preemptions, and idle times.

- **Explanatory Panels**  
  Includes algorithm walkthrough and column definitions.

## How It Works

The SRTF engine performs a time-driven simulation:

1. At each unit of time `t`, all jobs with `AT ≤ t` enter the **ready queue**.
2. The algorithm selects the job with the **minimum remaining burst time**.
3. Execution proceeds for 1 unit.  
4. If a new job arrives with a shorter remaining time, the current job is **preempted**.
5. The Gantt Chart logs all CPU activity (including idle periods).
6. After all jobs finish, the system computes the final statistics.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willardcsoriano/SRTF-100Job-Stochastic-Analysis.git
cd SRTF-100Job-Stochastic-Analysis
```

Then simply open `index.html` in a browser, or run a lightweight local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
```

Visit:  
`http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

1. Open the web interface.  
2. Click **“Run 100-Job Simulation”**.  
3. The following will appear:
   - Job table with all computed metrics  
   - Average Waiting Time & Turnaround Time  
   - Gantt Chart of CPU execution  
4. Optionally enable **Explanations** for a detailed breakdown of:
   - Column definitions  
   - SRTF logic  
   - Real-world relevance  

Each click generates a **new randomized dataset**.

---

## Example Output

A typical result displays:

- **Avg. Waiting Time (e.g., ~7.82)**  
- **Avg. Turnaround Time (e.g., ~13.21)**  
- **Complete Gantt Chart** showing preemptions  
- **100-row results table**

> Output varies each run because job parameters are random.
